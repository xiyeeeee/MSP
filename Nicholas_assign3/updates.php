Assistant Features
Joining stack and pull timers, Dota Plus now includes a Rune Spawn Indicator, which you can see when pressing Alt. In addition, the Plus Neutral Item Upgrade Recommendations have also been promoted to a core Plus feature, helping you keep track of neutral items in your team's stash that might better fit your hero than your current choice.
